Business Case/Drivers

Many universities commonly rely on disconnected platforms such as learning management systems (LMS), registration systems, calendars, and email to deliver academic and administrative services. The separation of these services can create inconsistent information access, communication delays, and added complexity for students, lecturers, administrators, and other roles involved in academic operations. For instance, students have to search through several systems to find answers to their concerns, while lecturers and administrators face challenges delivering timely updates and information to students. Meanwhile, maintenance teams are required to make complex decisions to keep up with growing demands for real-time performance, availability, and scalability. 

To address these drivers. To address these drivers, the AIDAP platform can be seen as a solution by providing a connected, conversational interface that integrates existing systems. This allows students to retrieve information, reminders, and manage their own schedules in one place. Lecturers can publish their content, announcements, and track participation and engagement, while administrators can issue alerts campus-wide. System maintainers can deploy updates with zero-downtime, allowing the system to remain robust and up to date. By allowing the connection of fragmented systems through AIDAP, institutions can deliver more reliable and secure services to every user.
