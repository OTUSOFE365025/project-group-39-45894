## Iteration 1

### Step 1: Selecting and Refining Architectural Drivers

**Focusing on:**

**Main use cases (from Phase 1):**

- UC-1 – Query Assistant  
- UC-2 – Notifications  
- UC-5 – Alerts/Announcements

- QA-2 – Availability  
- QA-3 – Security/Privacy  
- QA-4 – Scalability  
- QA-5 – Interoperability  
- QA-6 – Modifiability  

**Constraints:**

### Step 2: Establish the Iteration Goal

The goal of this iteration is to establish an overall architecture for the AIDAP system. There are multiple drivers that can influence the general structure of this system’s architecture. The following drivers are those that can have a large impact:

**Quality attributes:**

- QA-1 – Performance  
- QA-2 – Availability  
- QA-3 – Security/Privacy  
- QA-4 – Scalability  
- QA-5 – Interoperability  
- QA-6 – Modifiability  

**Constraints:**

- CON-1 – Support of 5000 concurrent users  
- CON-2 – User authentication through SSO  
- CON-3 – Standard API Interaction (REST/GraphQL)  
- CON-4 – System deployment must be cloud-native  
- CON-5 – Must be available 99.5% of the time  
- CON-6 – Accessible to different people and devices

### Step 3: Choose One or More Elements to Refine

- Overall AIDAP system (users and external systems)  
- User interaction layer (chat and dashboard)  
- Notifications/Event Processing (Query assistant and notifications)

### Step 4: Choose Design Concepts that Satisfy the Drivers

| Design Concept                          | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layered Architecture**               | Supports modifiability (QA-6) by separating concerns. This allows updates to UI, logic, or integrations to occur independently.                                                                           |
| **REST-based integration layer**       | Required to integrate with the learning management system, registration, and calendar system. Ensures interoperability (QA-5) and retry logic for availability (QA-2).                                    |
| **Event Driven Messaging / Message Queue** | Supports performance (QA-1) and scalability (QA-4) by decoupling alerts, notifications, and syncing events. Asynchronous operations can occur for notifications (UC-2) and alerts (UC-5).           |
| **Zero Downtime Deployment**           | Allows uninterrupted updates and maintenance, supporting availability (QA-2) and system operations (UC-6).                                                                                                |
| **API Gateway + Sign-in Authentication** | Focuses on access control and supports security/privacy (QA-3). Ensures that all user roles (students, lecturers, administrators, maintainers) can access only the features they are allowed to use. |

### Step 5: Instantiate Architecture Elements

| Design Decision and Location                        | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create API Gateway at system boundary**           | Controls all access using sign-in authentication, then routes requests to internal services. Supports security/privacy (QA-3), ensuring a consistent point of entry for system users.    |
| **Add QueryAssistantService in the business logic layer** | Handles student queries and AI processing, supporting performance (QA-1) and overall scalability.                                                                                         |
| **Add NotificationService in the business logic layer**   | Implements UC-2 and supports campus alerts (UC-5). Ensures efficient notifications under heavy load and supports scalability (QA-4).                                                     |
| **Add DataSyncService in the integration layer**    | Implements UC-7 by syncing with LMS, registration, and calendar systems. Supports consistency and interoperability within the system (QA-7 and QA-5).                                    |
| **Create SystemOperationsModule in operations layer**     | Handles monitoring operations, system health, and zero-downtime updates. Supports system operations and availability.                                                                    |

### Step 7: Evaluate Iteration 1 Design Against Drivers

| Scenario                    | Status               | Design Decision Made                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UC-1 – Query Assistant**  | Completely addressed | `QueryAssistantService` was added in the business logic layer to handle student AI queries and fast responses.                                                                                         |
| **UC-2 – Notifications**    | Completely addressed | `NotificationService` was added to manage reminders and push notifications at smaller or larger scales.                                                                                                |
| **UC-6 – System Operations**| Completely addressed | `SystemOperationsModule` supports system supervision tasks like runtime diagnostics, service health, deployment, and any maintenance or updates that are required.                                     |
| **UC-7 – Data Sync Services** | Completely addressed | `DataSyncService` was added to ensure information remains consistent across each subsystem and runs properly throughout the entire platform.                                                           |
| **QA-1 – Performance**      | Partially addressed  | Performance is improved by distributing high-traffic features into dedicated services and applying initial caching, improving responsiveness.                                                          |
| **QA-7 – Consistency**      | Completely addressed | Consistency is supported by adding `DataSyncService` and `ExternalSystemConnectors`, which manage interactions with subsystems of the platform. This ensures consistent data flow and easier evolution of university systems. |
